       "\"What is LangChain and what does it offer in terms of developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs)?\\n\\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle, including development, productionization, and deployment. Users can build applications using LangChain's open-source components and third-party integrations, create stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support using LangGraph, and inspect, monitor, and evaluate applications with LangSmith. Additionally, LangChain implements a standard interface for large language models and integrates with hundreds of providers.\""
